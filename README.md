# Starbucks-Portal
Starbucks is an international coffeeshop that is arguably the most famous worldwide. It started as a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground coffee, tea and spices with a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 1971. The company now operates more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries. Starbucks recently started leveraging analytics and data science to improve and optimize their operations. The goal of our project is to contribute to Starbucks’s analytics by developing tools providing various pieces of information and services, that would be of benefit for Starbucks’s internal users.
